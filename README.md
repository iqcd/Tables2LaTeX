# Tables2LaTeX
A simple, yet useful python script that converts your “.txt” tables into LaTeX code. 
## How to use
Just run “Tables2LaTeX.py”, and answer each of the questions:
* **Name of the file?**
* **Vertical lines?**
* **Horizontal lines?**
* **Text Aling?**
	* *l* = left.
	* *c* = center.
	* *r* = right.

> **ProTip**: write “%” for a *empty cell*, and “\~” for a *blank space*.
